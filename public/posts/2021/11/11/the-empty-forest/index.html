  <h1>The Empty Forest</h1>
  <time datetime=2021-11-11T00:00:00Z class="post-date">Thu, Nov 11, 2021</time>
  <p>If a tree is felled in an empty forest,
</br>condemned by a supreme act of violence and willpower, to lie
</br>silently on the ground while the trunk decomposes, as a buffalo
</br>awaits extinction at the same hands; to be more exact,
</br>who is responsible for this irresistible influence, this spark
</br>of a civilization that knows not of its own reach nor force?</p>
<p>Ever is great nature met with great force,
</br>for adjacent the tree moves a great army through the forest,
</br>made up of trillions of organisms big enough only to spark
</br>the wildfire that spreads until only charred trunks lie
</br>to conceal the strength of nature even in death, to exact
</br>some cruel revenge on those who killed the buffalo.</p>
<p>O weary! be those who would buffalo the buffalo,
</br>O cautious! O reverence! for that great, mighty force,
</br>for none may surmise the magnitude of the exact
</br>nature of the nature offended in the deforested forest.
</br>Be it man&rsquo;s nature to deceive, cheat, lie,
</br>Australia burns, billowing black smoke from a spark.</p>
<p>Could New York ignore such an inconsequential spark,
</br>that might return as an infernal blaze to avenge the buffalo
</br>whose carcasses today can be found in the ground, that lie
</br>in lieu of some impetus to move and breathe, some force
</br>of life? Were they deprived thereof by the men in the forest,
</br>whose intentions may never have been quite so exact,</p>
<p>yet whose actions could not possibly exact
</br>a greater impact than supplying the tinder for the spark.
</br>But did not man also emerge from that same forest,
</br>wherein he felled the tree and killed the buffalo,
</br>an equally natural and beautiful creature of the force
</br>that binds limb to limb, that gives him the ability to lie</p>
<p>in wait of the sunrise over the charred remains, that lie
</br>desolate in the wake of the fire yet never die in an exact,
</br>scientific manner; for the army of organisms comprise such a force
</br>to ensure that never did a creature die that didnâ€™t produce a spark
</br>which might one day give rise to a new creature, like the buffalo
</br>emerged from the bison, and the bison again from the forest.</p>
<p>When men lie prone in the forest,
</br>they cannot conceive of the force of the spark
</br>that might exact the same fate as the buffalo.</p>
