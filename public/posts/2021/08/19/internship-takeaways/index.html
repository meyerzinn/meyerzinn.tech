  <h1>Summer as a transit magician</h1>

  <p>There are a lot of things I expected when I accepted a summer internship with Cloudflare&rsquo;s Magic Transit team. I figured they would send me some nice swag (thanks for the socks!), and I would have to write some code.</p>
<p>What I did <em>not</em> anticipate was shipping that code to Cloudflare’s edge to improve routing of trillions of bytes of data for real customers every day. I also did not expect my work to have a substantial, quantifiable impact on the product within twelve short weeks.</p>
<p>I wrote a <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/making-magic-transit-health-checks-faster-and-more-responsive/">Cloudflare blog post</a> with the technical details of my work, but I wanted to share some takeaways from this summer that make it in:</p>
<ol>
<li>Planning and testing are important. I was hired to help monitor Internet weather, not cause a storm. Corollary: Sometimes moving slowly in the right direction is better than moving at break-neck speed into a wall.</li>
<li>Things break in weird ways when you scale them up by 10,000x.</li>
<li>The key to understanding distributed systems is observability: anticipating every problem you might encounter is impossible, so it’s important to keep a lot of data and logs that will help you identify problems as they arise.</li>
</ol>
