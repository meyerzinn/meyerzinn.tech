If a tree is felled in an empty forest,
</br>condemned by a supreme act of violence and willpower, to lie 
</br>silently on the ground while the trunk decomposes, as a buffalo 
</br>awaits extinction at the same hands; to be more exact, 
</br>who is responsible for this irresistible influence, this spark 
</br>of a civilization that knows not of its own reach nor force? 
 
Ever is great nature met with great force, 
</br>for adjacent the tree moves a great army through the forest, 
</br>made up of trillions of organisms big enough only to spark 
</br>the wildfire that spreads until only charred trunks lie 
</br>to conceal the strength of nature even in death, to exact 
</br>some cruel revenge on those who killed the buffalo. 

O weary! be those who would buffalo the buffalo, 
</br>O cautious! O reverence! for that great, mighty force, 
</br>for none may surmise the magnitude of the exact 
</br>nature of the nature offended in the deforested forest. 
</br>Be it man's nature to deceive, cheat, lie, 
</br>Australia burns, billowing black smoke from a spark. 

Could New York ignore such an inconsequential spark, 
</br>that might return as an infernal blaze to avenge the buffalo 
</br>whose carcasses today can be found in the ground, that lie 
</br>in lieu of some impetus to move and breathe, some force 
</br>of life? Were they deprived thereof by the men in the forest, 
</br>whose intentions may never have been quite so exact, 

yet whose actions could not possibly exact 
</br>a greater impact than supplying the tinder for the spark. 
</br>But did not man also emerge from that same forest, 
</br>wherein he felled the tree and killed the buffalo, 
</br>an equally natural and beautiful creature of the force 
</br>that binds limb to limb, that gives him the ability to lie

in wait of the sunrise over the charred remains, that lie 
</br>desolate in the wake of the fire yet never die in an exact, 
</br>scientific manner; for the army of organisms comprise such a force 
</br>to ensure that never did a creature die that didnâ€™t produce a spark 
</br>which might one day give rise to a new creature, like the buffalo 
</br>emerged from the bison, and the bison again from the forest. 

When men lie prone in the forest, 
</br>they cannot conceive of the force of the spark 
</br>that might exact the same fate as the buffalo.
